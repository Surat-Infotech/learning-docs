# JavaScript Course — 8-Week Weekly Roadmap (30 hours/week)

This roadmap turns the [JavaScript Course](README.md) into a clear weekly plan.

- **Time budget:** 30 hours per week
- **Total length:** 8 weeks (~240 hours)
- **Split:** About **40% reading/watching** and **60% writing code** (so ~12 hours
  reading and ~18 hours coding each week).

> **How to read this plan.** Each week lists the lessons to study, a suggested
> day-by-day breakdown, and a small project to build at the end. Type every
> example yourself, do the lesson exercises, then build the weekly project. If a
> week feels heavy, it is fine to slow down — understanding beats speed.

**Weekly rhythm (suggested):** 5 study days × ~5 hours, or 6 days × 5 hours.
Keep one short day for review and rest.

## Week 1 — Setup and Fundamentals

**Goal:** Get your tools ready and learn the basic building blocks of code.

**Lessons (Module 0 + Module 1):**

- [How JavaScript Works](00-getting-started/01-how-javascript-works.md)
- [Setup and Running Your First Code](00-getting-started/02-setup-and-running-code.md)

| 4 | 5 | Conditionals lesson + exercises. |
| 5 | 5 | Loops lesson + exercises. |
| 6 | 5 | **Weekly project** (below) + review weak spots. |

**Weekly project — Console Warm-Up Scripts** (~3–4 hours, rest of day 6 for review):

1. **FizzBuzz** — print 1 to 100, but "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for
   multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for both.
2. **Number checker** — log whether a number is positive/negative/zero and even/odd.
3. **Simple calculator** — a function taking two numbers and an operator
   (`+ - * /`) returning the result; handle divide-by-zero.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can use `const`/`let` correctly and translate plain
English logic into loops and conditionals.

---

## Week 2 — Functions and Scope

**Goal:** Write reusable logic and understand where variables live.

**Lessons (Module 2):**

- [Functions](02-functions-and-scope/01-functions.md)
- [Arrow Functions](02-functions-and-scope/02-arrow-functions.md)
- [Scope and Hoisting](02-functions-and-scope/03-scope-and-hoisting.md)

| Day | Hours | What to do |
| --- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1 | 5 | Functions lesson + exercises. |
| 2 | 5 | Arrow Functions lesson + exercises. |
| 3 | 6 | Scope and Hoisting lesson + exercises (take your time). |
| 4 | 6 | Closures lesson + exercises (go slow — important topic). |

| 6 | 3 | **Weekly project** + review. |

**Weekly project — Mini Function Library** (~3 hours):

Write a small file of useful, reusable functions, each tested in the console:

- `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` (arrow functions)
- `isEven(n)`, `max(a, b)`, `clamp(value, min, max)`
- `makeCounter()` — a **closure** that returns a function giving the next number each call.
- `greet(name = "friend")` — uses a default parameter.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can write functions confidently and explain what a
closure is with a simple example.

---

## Week 3 — Data Structures

**Goal:** Store and transform collections of data.

**Lessons (Module 3):**

| 5 | 5 | Sets & Maps + Destructuring/Spread/Rest lessons. |
| 6 | 5 | **Weekly project** + review. |

**Weekly project — To-Do List Engine (logic only, no UI)** (~5 hours):

Each task looks like `{ id: 1, text: "Buy milk", done: false }`, stored in an array.

- `addTask(text)` — adds a task with a unique id and `done: false`.
- `removeTask(id)` — removes a task (use `filter`).
- `toggleTask(id)` — flips `done` (use `map`).
- `listTasks()` — prints all tasks nicely.
- `countRemaining()` — returns how many tasks are not done.
- **Stretch:** `clearCompleted()` removes all done tasks.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can model data with arrays of objects and transform
it with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

Connect your Week 3 to-do logic to a real page.

- Input box + "Add" button to create tasks.
- Tasks render as a list (build each `<li>` dynamically).
- Clicking a task toggles it done (line-through via a CSS class).
- Each task has a "Delete" button.
- Show a live count of remaining tasks.
- Empty input does nothing (validate it).
- **Stretch:** All / Active / Completed filter.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can connect your data (an array) to the screen (the
DOM) and respond to user actions.

| 5–6 | 6 | **Weekly project** + review. |

**Weekly project — Fake Data Loader** (~5 hours):

1. `getUser(id)` returns a **Promise** using `setTimeout` (~1.5s) to resolve with
   `{ id, name: "User " + id }`.
2. **Reject** if the id is negative.
3. Call it with `.then()` / `.catch()`.
4. Rewrite the call with **`async`/`await`** inside `try`/`catch`.
5. Show "Loading…" before the data arrives.
6. **Stretch:** Load three users in sequence with `await`, then all at once with `Promise.all`.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You understand why async exists and how `async`/`await`
makes Promises readable.

---

## Week 6 — APIs and Real Data

**Goal:** Connect your app to the real world.

**Lessons (Module 5, lessons 5–6) + review:**

- [Fetch and JSON](05-asynchronous-javascript/05-fetch-and-json.md)

Pick one: GitHub user search (easiest, no key), movie search (OMDb/TMDB), or
weather (Open-Meteo, no key).

- Input + button (or live search as you type).
- Use `fetch` with `async`/`await`.
- Show a **"Loading…"** state while waiting.
- Show a friendly **error message** on failure (`try`/`catch`).
- Render results as cards (image, title, a couple of details).
- **Stretch:** Save the last search to LocalStorage; debounce live search.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can fetch data from an API, handle loading/errors,
and display the results.

---

**Weekly project — Refactor and Modularize** (~4 hours):

Take your Week 6 search app and improve it:

- Split it into **ES Modules**: `api.js`, `ui.js`, `storage.js`, `main.js`.
- Add a `debounce` helper (from Advanced Patterns) to your live search.
- Use **optional chaining** (`?.`) when reading API fields that might be missing.
- **Stretch:** Model a result as a small **class** with a method (e.g. `User.displayName()`).

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can split code into modules and read advanced JS
(classes, prototypes, generators) without fear.

Build one complete app that combines everything.

- Add an expense with description, amount, and category.
- Edit and delete expenses.
- Show a running **total** and a **breakdown by category** (use `reduce`).
- **Persist** all data in LocalStorage so it survives reload.
- Filter by category or date; validate input.
- **API feature:** fetch live currency rates (e.g. exchangerate.host) and show
  the total in a second currency, with loading/error states.
- **Delivery:** organize into ES Modules, write clean code, commit to Git, push
  to GitHub with a README, and (bonus) deploy on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

✅ **End-of-week check:** You can plan, build, debug, and publish a full app on
your own.
